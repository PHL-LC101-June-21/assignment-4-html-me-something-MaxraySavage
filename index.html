            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
               While building Calculationster, a game written with only HTML/CSS and Javascript I was faced with an interesting problem.
               We were building a game to help kids practice basic arithmetic and we decidedwe wanted to include arithmetic expressions with more than two terms. 
               However, once you start looking at expressions like this, we need PEMDAS to solve them! 
               I was also working on the logic to generate the problems randomly and I realized I needed to be able to step through PEMDAS in order to make sure the problems were working the way we needed them to. 
               In this article I'll attempt to describe how I solved this problem using javascript!
            </p>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p class ="funParagraph" id="testP">
               In order to build this featuree, a function that solves an expression with PEMDAS, we have to define what an expression will look like and what PEMDAS is. 
               For this article we will only consider a rather small subset of possible mathematical expressions. Specifically, an expression will be an array of alternating numbers and binary operators. For our game we did not include parentheses in our problems, we will consider their addition ina future article.
               So an example of an expression would be <code>[1, '+', 5]</code> and we would expect this to equal 6 when solved.
               Now PEMDAS is a <em>convention</em> of written mathematics and it is not the end all. However it is a convention that can be challenging to learn so we want to help people learn it in our game.
               For our purposes, PEMDAS will mean the following:
               <ol>
                  <li><strong>Parentheses</strong> Evaluate terms im parentheses first (we didn't do this inour project)</li>
                  <li><strong>Exponents</strong> Exponents, denoted in javascript with the binary operator <code>**</code>. Under our current definition of an expression, we could have something like <code>[2, '**', 3]</code> and we would expect that to equal 8.</li>
                  <li><strong>Multiplication and Division</strong> We will evaluate multiplication and division from left to right, simultaneously. 
                     While javascript uses '*' as the multiplication operator, in our code we used 'x' because that is closer to how arithmetic is taught. 
                     In our code, an expression using multiplication and division might look like <code>[54, '/', 9, 'x', 7]</code> which we would evalute from left to right, first getting <math>54 / 9  = 6</math> and then <math>6 x 7 = 42</math>. 
                     Notice that if we did multiplication and then division we would instead end up with <math>54 / 42</math> because we did the multiplication first, leaving us with the fraction <math>9/7</math>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Addition and Subtraction</strong> We then evaluate addition and subtraction left to right just like multiplication and division. We can also see the same potential for misunderstanding with the expression <code>[20, '-', 5, '+' 32]</code>. 
                  Done our way, this will result in <math>20 - 5 = 15</math> and then <math>15 + 32 = 47</math> whereas if we did addition then subtraction we'd end up with <math>20 - 37 = -17</math> </li>
               </ol> 
               So we can see that evaluating an expression with require a tiered approach. First we will look for parentheses, if we don't find them, we will look for an exponent, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction. It is my feeling that implementing parentheses is best done recursively after completing a solver that works on the later tiers so let's do that first.
                        </p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
            We will evaluate the expression in three tiers, first exponentiation, then multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction. Let's declare an array called evalTiers where each index contains all the operands we will look for at each tier. 
            For us this will look something like
            <div class='code-container'><pre><code>
const evalTiers = [
   '**',
   ['x', '/'],
   ['+', '-']
];
            </code></pre></div>
            Now we can start to build our function evalExpression (I'm using the spread operator ... here to avoid changing the input array)
            <div class='code-container'><pre><code>
function evalExpression(expressionArray) {
   const expression = [...expressionArray];
   for(const tierOperands of evalTiers) {
      // do something
   }
}   
            </code></pre></div>
            What's the something though? We have to look through the expression to see if the operation in the current tier is represented. I did this with the findIndex array method as follows:
            <div class='code-container'><pre><code>
let nextOperatorIndex = expression.findIndex((o) => tierOperands.includes(o));
            </code></pre></div>
            This will return the index of the first item in the expression array that is included in the array of operands in the current tier or return -1 if none are found. 
            We want to continue evaluation on the array until there are no more operands in our current tier. Therefore we can implement a while loop where we do something to the expression array while our nextOperatorIndex is not 0. 
            That would look like this:
            <div class='code-container'><pre><code>
function evalExpression(expressionArray) {
   const expression = [...expressionArray];
   for(const tierOperands of evalTiers) {
      let nextOperatorIndex = expression.findIndex((o) => tierOperands.includes(o));
      while (nextOperatorIndex !== -1) {
         //do something
         nextOperatorIndex = expression.findIndex((o) => tierOperands.includes(o));
      }
   }
}   
            </code></pre></div>            
            So in our while loop we have to do something with nextOperatorIndex. We want to evaluate whatever operation that nextOperatorIndex is pointing us to.
            Let's look at a small example. If we had the array [1, '+', 3, 'x', 7] and nextoperatorIndex is currently 3, what should we do? 
            We need to look at the operator at index 3, see if it tells us to multiply, divide, add, etc. and then do that to the things at index 2 and 4, and then replaces all 3 things with the result.
            So in this case we replace the [3, 'x', 7] portion of the array with 21 leaving us with [1, '+', 21]. How do we do this with code? 
            First we can write a helper function to handle figuring out what operation to do and then doing it.
            <div class='code-container'><pre><code>
function evalOperation(operandOne, operator, operandTwo) {
   switch (operator) {
      case '**':
        return operandOne ** operandTwo;
      
      case 'x':
        return operandOne * operandTwo;
  
      case '/':
        return operandOne / operandTwo;
  
      case '+':
        return operandOne + operandTwo;
  
      case '-':
        return operandOne - operandTwo;
  
      default:
        return 'Error, should be a valid operator';
    }
}
            </code></pre></div>
            We can then use this helper function to replace the array elements from index = nextOperatorIndex - 1, to nextOperatorIndex + 1 with the result of the operation like so:
            <div class='code-container'><pre><code>
function evalExpression(expressionArray) {
   const expression = [...expressionArray];
   for(const tierOperands of evalTiers) {
      let nextOperatorIndex = expression.findIndex((o) => tierOperands.includes(o));
      while (nextOperatorIndex !== -1) {
         const operator = expression[nextOperatorIndex];
         const operandOne = expression[nextOperatorIndex - 1];
         const operandTwo = expression[nextOperatorIndex + 1];
         const result = evalOperation(operandOne, operator, operandTwo);
         expression.splice(nextOperatorIndex - 1, 3, result);
         nextOperatorIndex = expression.findIndex((o) => tierOperands.includes(o));
      }
   }
   return expression[0];
}         
            </code></pre></div>
            And with that, we're done!
            </p>
